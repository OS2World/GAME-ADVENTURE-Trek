This port was done by Bryan Whitehead <driver@technologist.com>
It was a very easy port just had to comment out some BSD (sgtty)
style stuff.... other than that a Makefile had to be created for
EMX (hell the one included wouldn't worl on any GNU based
Makefile..)

Anyhow... it was all John Thompson's idea... so thank him also.

Have fun and enjoy!
