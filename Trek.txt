Ancient text-mode Trek game.

This is an ancient game; I can remember playing it (or an earlier
version, at least) on a PDP-11/20 when I was in college in the 
mid-1970's.  If you're into fast-paced shoot-em-ups you probably 
won't like it.  Everything is text, just as it was when played on
a teletype spewing paper with every move.

So why bother porting such a game?  My son, almost 13 years old 
now, found a version of it on his uncle's DEC System 5400 and was
captivated (but then he's been a fan of Will Crowther's text
"Adventure" game since about age 6).  My brother and I tracked
the source code down to a site in Australia and Bryan Whitehead 
was kind enough to port it to OS/2 for me with the emx compiler. 
Now my son can play it at home on our OS/2 machine instead of
hanging out at his uncle's endlessly or telnet-ing into the DEC
machine and tying up our phone lines :-)

If you think you'd enjoy a "blast from the past" give it a try.
At least it could give you an idea how people played with
computers back in the dark ages.

So, enjoy.  My next project is to compile it for DOS...
